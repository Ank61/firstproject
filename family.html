            <h2>Family Dinner</h2>
            <p>As a busy mom, the most challenging part of my day is dinner time. Successfully putting a healthy meal on the table each night is contingent upon making timely grocery runs, completing carpools, navigating cross-town sports pickups and more. Sometimes I do all this masterfully and the dinner still sucks–I shouldn’t say that–but that’s how it feels when I’ve tried my hardest to gather the family around the table only to burn the meatloaf.</p>

            <h2>Outdoor Adventure</h2>
            <p>For families who enjoy the outdoors, get a gift card to a sporting goods store like REI or Bass Pro Shops. The family can use the card to buy camping gear, hiking boots for everyone, a hammock for the backyard, boogie boards for the beach or snowboards for the slopes. Make it fun by delivering the gift card with homemade trail mix, all the fixings needed to make s’mores or a road-trip snack the family can enjoy en route to their adventure. Another idea is to buy the family a season pass to a nearby amusement park, water park or ski slope. With admission paid for, all they’ll need to do is clear their schedules.</p>

            <h2>The Gift of Anywhere or Anything!</h2>
            <p>While I sincerely believe that families who play together will stay together, sometimes the best gift you can give a family is more practical. A Visa® gift card, for example, can be used wherever Visa is accepted, so the family could choose to spend it on something fun, like going to the movies, or on something needed, like groceries, a medical co-pay or gas. Gift cards to stores like Target, Walmart, Costco and Safeway are almost just as flexible because they can be used to purchase a wide array of items–also ranging from fun (DVD’s, picnic supplies, colored markers) to mundane (milk, aspirin, toothpaste). Gas station gift cards might cover fuel to go between soccer games or a family road trip to see Grandma. As long as the gift card can be redeemed nearby, I’m certain a family can find a fun way to use it. (To spice up a practical gift card, deliver it with five family-friendly recipes that everyone in your family enjoys.)</p>

            <h2>At-Home Entertainment</h2>
            <p>With at-home entertainment gift cards, I’m thinking of both ends of the technology spectrum. Gift cards to Crutchfield Electronics, Amazon or Apple can be used to upgrade the family television, find a new an Xbox game or buy a tablet for everyone to share. That’s one way to go, but a low-tech option may be just as desirable. With a gift card to Michaels or Hobby Lobby, the family can buy an art project to do together such as tie dye t-shirts, make mosaic stepping stones or dig into sand art.

                Another option is to buy a gift card to a home store such as Bed, Bath & Beyond. The family can, of course, use the card to buy pillows or something decorative, but you might suggest using it to buy a panini grill, soda machine or shaved ice maker that the family can enjoy using together</p>

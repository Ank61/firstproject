        <p style="font-size: large;">
        Thinking out of the Gift Box on the fly? Nothing speaks quite like a thoughtful gift for those special occasions when you want to thank someone and tell them how much they mean to you.<br> <br> But the best gifts in life rarely come in a box. They comprise alluring encounters and exquisite experiences that make precious memories â€” the kind that you return to over and over again. Taj Experiences eGift Cards feature artistic watercolour motifs in a range of themed design options that take inspiration from our iconic heritage and art and celebrate the myriad cultural traditions of our festivals, from Christmas baubles on mango trees to the fanous and kandeels that light up Eid and Diwali. Delivered instantly and redeemable immediately across Taj, SeleQtions and Vivanta hotels and Ama Trails & Stays in India, Taj Experiences eCards are the perfect gift for a birthday, engagement, wedding or festive celebration.
